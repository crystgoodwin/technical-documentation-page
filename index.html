    <p><strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
    <p>A <strong>document</strong> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
    <h3>How does CSS affect HTML?</h3>

<p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example, <em>I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</em></li>
    <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, <em>I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A set of CSS rules contained within a <strong>stylesheet</strong> determines how a webpage should look. You will learn a lot more about what CSS syntax looks like in the next article of the module — CSS Syntax.</p>
    <h4 class="example">A quick CSS example</h4>
    <p>Let's take a simple HTML document, containing an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (notice that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element):</p>
<p>
  <pre>
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>
</p>
  <p>Now let's look at a very simple CSS example containing two rules:</p>
<p>
  <pre>
  h1 &#125;
    color: blue;
    background-color: yellow;
    border: 1px solid black;
    &#123;

    p &#125;
    color: red;
    &#123;
  </pre>
</p>
<p>The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the <code> &lt;h1&gt;</code> element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value pair is called a <strong>declaration</strong>):</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
  <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
  <li>The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.</li>
</ol>
The second rule starts with a <code>p</code> selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text color to red.</p>

    <header>How To Apply Your CSS to Your HTML</header>
  <article>
  <p>There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, some more useful than others. Here we'll briefly review each one.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>External stylesheet</li>
    <p>An external stylesheet is when you have your CSS written in a separate file with a .css extension, and you reference it from an HTML <link> element. <strong>Best method</strong>, as you can use one stylesheet to style multiple documents, and would only need to update the CSS in one place if changes were needed.</p>
    <li>Internal stylesheet</li>
    <p>An internal stylesheet is where you don't have an external CSS file, but instead place your CSS inside a <code>style</code> element, contained inside the HTML head. <strong>Useful in some circumstances</strong>, but isn't as efficient as external stylesheets.</p>
    <li>Inline sytles</li>
    <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect one element only, contained within a <code>style</code> attribute. <strong>Not recommended</strong>, it is really bad for maintenance, and it also mixes your presentational CSS information with your HTML structural information, making the CSS harder to read and understand.</p>
  </ol>
  </article>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="css_syntax">
    <header>CSS Syntax</header>
    <article>
    <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g., font, width, background color) you want to change.</li>
  <li><strong>Values</strong>: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g., what you want to change the font, width, or background color to.)</li>
    </ul>
<p>A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).</p>
    <h2>Syntax in Detail</h2>
    <h4 class="example">CSS declarations</h4>
    <p>Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style it. The property and value in each pair is separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).</p>
    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/3665/css%20syntax%20-%20declaration.png" class="responsive">
    <p>There are more than <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">300 different properties</a> in CSS and nearly an infinite number of different values. Not all pairs of properties and values are allowed. Each property has a specific list of valid <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units">values</a> defined for it.</p>

    <h4 class="example">CSS declaration blocks</h4>
    <p>Declarations are grouped in blocks, with each set of declarations being wrapped by an opening curly brace (<code>&#123;</code>) and a closing one (<code>&#125;</code>).</p>
    <p>The declarations inside a <strong>declaration block</strong> must be separated by semi-colons (;), otherwise the code won't work (or will at least give unexpected results). The last declaration of a block doesn't need to be terminated by a semi-colon. However, it is often considered <em>good style</em> to do so as it prevents forgetting to add it when extending the block with another declaration.</p>

    <header>Selectors Introduction</header>
    <article>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine grained precision when selecting elements to style. </p>

    <h4 class="example">Different types of selectors</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple selectors</strong>: Match one or more elements based on element type, <code>class</code>, or <code>id</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribute selectors</strong>: Match one or more elements based on their attributes/attribute values.</li>
      <li><strong>Pseudo-classes</strong>: Match one or more elements that exist in a certain state, such as an element that is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox that is currently disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</li>
      <li><strong>Pseudo-elements</strong>: Match one or more parts of content that are in a certain position in relation to an element, for example the first word of each paragraph, or generated content appearing just before an element.</li>
      <li><strong>Combinators</strong>: These are not exactly selectors themselves, but ways of combining two or more selectors in useful ways for very specific selections. So for example, you could select only paragraphs that are direct descendants of divs, or paragraphs that come directly after headings.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple selectors</strong>: Again, these are not separate selectors; the idea is that you can put multiple selectors on the same CSS rule, separated by commas, to apply a single set of declarations to all the elements selected by those selectors.</li>
    </ul>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="simple_selectors">
    <header>Simple Selectors</header>
    <article>
    <p>Simple selectors directly match one or more elements of a document, based on the type of element, <code>class</code>, or <code>id</code>.

    <h2>Type selectors aka element selectors</h2>
    <p>HTML:</p>
    </p>
  <pre>
  &lt;p&gt;What color do you like?&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
</p>
    <p>A simple style sheet:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
    p &#123;
      color: red;
      &#125;
  </pre>
</p>

 <h2>Class selectors</h2>
<p>The class selector consists of a dot, '<code>.</code>', followed by a class name. A class name is any value, without spaces, placed within an HTML <code>class</code> attribute. It is up to you to choose a name for the class.</p>
    <p>HTML:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li class="first">Create an HTML document&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="second done">Create a CSS style sheet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  </pre>
</p>
    <p>A simple style sheet that styles two of these classes:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
    .first &#123;
      font-weight: bold;
      &#125;

    .done &#123;
      text-decoration: line-through;
      &#125;
  </pre>
</p>
<h2>ID selectors</h2>
<p>The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (<code>#</code>), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any element can have a unique ID name set with the <code>id</code> attribute. It is up to you to choose an ID name. It's the most efficient way to select a single element.</p>
    <p>HTML:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
  &lt;p id="polite"&gt; - "Good morning."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p id="rude"&gt; - "Go away!"&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
</p>
    <p>A simple style sheet:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
    #polite &#123;
      font-family: cursive;
      &#125;

    #rude &#123;
      font-family: monospace;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      &#125;
  </pre>
</p>
</article>
  </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="attribute_selectors">
        <header>Attribute Selectors</header>
        <article>
        <p>Attribute selectors are a special kind of selector that will match elements based on their attributes and attribute values. Their generic syntax consists of square brackets &#40;<code>[]</code>&#41; containing an attribute name followed by an optional condition to match against the value of the attribute. Attribute selectors can be divided into two categories depending on the way they match attribute values: <strong>Presence and value</strong> attribute selectors and Substring value attribute selectors.</p>

    <h2>Presence and value attribute selectors</h2>
    <p>These attribute selectors try to match an exact attribute value:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><code>[attr]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute <code>attr</code>, whatever its value.</li>
     <li><code>[attr=val]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute <code>attr</code>, but only if its value is <code>val</code>.</li>
     <li><code>[attr~=val]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute <code>attr</code>, but only if <code>val</code> is one of a space-separated list of words contained in <code>attr</code>'s value.</li>
   </ul>
        <p>HTML:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li data-quantity="1kg" data-vegetable&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li data-quantity="3" data-vegetable&gt;Onions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li data-quantity="700g" data-vegetable="not spicy like chili"&gt; Red pepper&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li data-quantity="2kg" data-meat&gt;Chicken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  </pre>
</p>
    <p>A simple style sheet:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
    [data-vegetable] &#123;
      color: green;
      &#125;

    [data-vegetable="liquid"] &#123;
      background-color: goldenrod;
      &#125;

      [data-vegetable~="spicy"] &#123;
      color: red;
      &#125;
  </pre>
</p>

<h2>Substring value attribute selectors</h2>
    <p>Attribute selectors in this class are also known as "RegExp-like selectors", because they offer flexible matching in a similar fashion to regular expression (but to be clear, these selectors are not true regular expression):</p>
   <ul>
     <li><code>[attr^=val]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value starts with <code>val</code>.</li>
     <li><code>[attr$=val]</code>: This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value ends with <code>val</code>.</li>
     <li><code>[attr*=val]</code>:  This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr for which the value contains the substring <code>val</code>. (A substring is simply part of a string, e.g. "cat" is a substring in the string "caterpillar".) </li>
   </ul>

    <p>Continuing with the previous example and add the following:</p>
    <p>
  <pre>
    [lang|="fr"] &#123;
      font-weight: bold;
      &#125;

    [data-quantity^="optional"] &#123;
      opacity: 0.5;
      &#125;

      [data-quantity$="kg"] &#123;
      font-weight: bold;
      &#125;

      [data-vegetable*="not spicy"] &#123;
      color: green;
      &#125;
  </pre>
</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="pseudo_classes_and_pseudo_elements">
        <header>Pseudo Classes and Pseudo Elements</header>
        <article>
        <h2>Psuedo Classes</h2>
        <p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon &#40;<code>:</code>&#41;, which is used to specify that you want to style the selected element but only when it is in a certain state. For example, you might want to style a link element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</p>
        <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="code-text"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active">:active</a></li>
          <li class="code-text"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked">:checked</a></li>
          <li class="code-text"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:default">:default</a></li>
          <li class="code-text"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first">:first</a></li>
          <li class="code-text"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus">:focus</a></li>
          <li class="code-text"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child">:nth-child</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Psuedo Elements</h2>
        <p>Pseudo-elements are very much like pseudo-classes, but they have differences. They are keywords, this time preceded by two colons &#40;<code>::</code>&#41;, that can be added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of an element.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="code-text"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after">::after</a></li>

        <header>Combinators and Multiple Selectors</header>
        <article>
        <p>Using one selector at a time is useful, but can be inefficient in some situations. CSS selectors become even more useful when you start combining them to perform fine-grained selections. CSS has several ways to select elements based on how they are related to one another. Those relationships are expressed with combinators as follows (A and B represent any selector seen above):</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Syntax</th>
            <th>Selects</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Selector list</td>
            <td><code>A, B</code></td>
            <td>Any element matching A and/or B (see Groups of selectors on one rule, below - Group of Selectors is not considered to be a combinator).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Descendant combinator</td>
            <td><code>A B</code></td>
            <td>Any element matching B that is a descendant of an element matching A (that is, a child, or a child of a child, etc.). the combinator is one or more spaces or dual greater than signs.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Child combinator</td>
            <td><code>A > B</code></td>
            <td>Any element matching B that is a direct child of an element matching A.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Adjacent sibling combinator</td>
            <td><code>A + B</code></td>
            <td>Any element matching B that is the next sibling of an element matching A (that is, the next child of the same parent).</td>
          </tr>

            <td>General sibling combinator</td>
            <td><code>A ~ B</code></td>

      <section class="main-section" id="cascade_and_inheritance">
        <header>Cascade and Inheritance</header>
        <article>
        <h2>The Cascade</h2>
        <p>CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets, which indicates that the notion of the cascade is important. At its most basic level, it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter, but it's more complex than that. What selectors win out in the cascade depends on three factors (these are listed in order of weight — earlier ones will overrule later ones):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Importance</li>
      <li>Specificity</li>
      <li>Source order</li>
     </ol>

        <h3>Importance</h3>
        <p>In CSS, there is a special piece of syntax you can use to make sure that a certain declaration will always win over all others: <code>!important</code>.</p>
        <h3>Specificity</h3>
        <p>Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector is — how many elements it could match. As shown in the example seen above, element selectors have low specificity. Class selectors have a higher specificity, so will win against element selectors. ID selectors have an even higher specificity, so will win against class selectors. A sure way to win against an ID selector is to use <code>!important</code>.</p>

    <p>The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or components), which can be thought of as thousands, hundreds, tens and ones — four single digits in four columns:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Thousands: Score one in this column if the declaration is inside a style attribute, aka inline styles. Such declarations don't have selectors, so their specificity is always simply 1000.</li>
    <li>Hundreds: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector.</li>
    <li>Tens: Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.</li>
    <li>Ones: Score one in this column for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Source order</h3>
        <p>As mentioned above, if multiple competing selectors have the same importance and specificity, the third factor that comes into play to help decide which rule wins is source order — later rules will win over earlier rules.</p>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>CSS inheritance is the last piece we need to investigate to get all the information and understand what style is applied to an element. The idea is that some property values applied to an element will be inherited by that element's children, and some won't.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, it makes sense for <code>font-family</code> and <code>color</code> to be inherited, as that makes it easy for you to set a site-wide base font by applying a font-family to the <html> element; you can then override the fonts on individual elements where needed. It would be really annoying to have to set the base font separately on every element.</li>
  <li>As another example, it makes sense for <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>background-image</code> to NOT be inherited. Imagine the styling/layout mess that would occur if you set these properties on a container element and had them inherited by every single child element, and then had to unset them all on each individual element!</li>

        <header>The Box Model</header>
        <article>
        <p>The CSS box model is the foundation of layout on the Web — each element is represented as a rectangular box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another like the layers of an onion. As a browser renders a web page layout, it works out what styles are applied to the content of each box, how big the surrounding onion layers are, and where the boxes sit in relation to one another.</p>
        <h2>Box properties</h2>
        <p>Every element within a document is structured as a rectangular box inside the document layout, the size and "onion layers" of which can be tweaked using some specific CSS properties. The relevant properties are as follows:</p>
        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13647/box-model-standard-small.png" class="responsive" />
        <h3>  <code>width</code> and <code>height</code></h3>
       <p> The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties set the width and height of the content box, which is the area in which the content of the box is displayed — this content includes both text content set inside the box, and other boxes representing nested child elements.</p>

        <h3>  <code>padding</code></h3>
        <p> <strong>Padding</strong> refers to the <em>inner</em> margin of a CSS box — between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge of the border. The size of this layer can be set on all four sides at once with the padding shorthand property, or one side at a time with the <code>padding-top</code>, <code>padding-right</code>, <code>padding-bottom</code> and <code>padding-left</code> properties.</p>
        <h3><code>border</code></h3>
        <p>The <strong>border</strong> of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default the border has a size of 0 — making it invisible — but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The <code>border</code> shorthand property allows you to set all of these on all four sides at once, for example <code>border: 1px solid black</code>. This can be broken down into numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>border-top</code>, <code>border-right</code>, <code>border-bottom</code>, <code>border-left</code>: Set the thickness, style and color of one side of the border.</li>
          <li><code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code>, <code>border-color</code>: Set only the thickness, style, or color individually, but for all four sides of the border.</li>
            <li>You can also set one of the three properties of a single side of the border individually, using <code>border-top-width</code>, <code>border-top-style</code>, <code>border-top-color</code>, etc.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3><code>margin</code></h3>
            <p>The margin surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout. It behaves rather like padding; the shorthand property is margin and the individual properties are <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>, <code>margin-bottom</code>, and <code>margin-left</code>.</p>
